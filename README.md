# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking

This is a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver that uses the backtracking technique to find a solution for a given Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, following specific rules. Each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids should contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

## How the Solver Works

The Sudoku solver is implemented using a recursive backtracking algorithm. It explores all possible combinations of numbers for each empty cell in the grid until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Find an empty cell in the Sudoku grid.
2. Try placing a number from 1 to 9 into the empty cell.
3. Check if the current number placement is valid for the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
4. If the placement is valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat steps 2-3.
5. If there are no valid numbers to place, backtrack to the previous empty cell and try a different number for that cell.
6. Continue the process until all empty cells are filled, and a valid solution is found.

The backtracking algorithm guarantees finding a solution if one exists for the given Sudoku puzzle.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `sudoku_solver.py` file.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `sudoku_solver.py`.

4. Modify the `sudoku_board` variable in `sudoku_solver.py` to represent the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. Use 0 to represent empty cells.

5. Run the solver using the following command:

   ```
   python sudoku_solver.py
   ```

6. If a solution exists for the provided puzzle, the solver will print the solved grid to the console.

## Example

The following is an example Sudoku puzzle represented as a 9x9 grid, where 0 indicates empty cells:

```
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0
0 9 8 | 0 0 0 | 0 6 0
---------------------
8 0 0 | 0 6 0 | 0 0 3
4 0 0 | 8 0 3 | 0 0 1
7 0 0 | 0 2 0 | 0 0 6
---------------------
0 6 0 | 0 0 0 | 2 8 0
0 0 0 | 4 1 9 | 0 0 5
0 0 0 | 0 8 0 | 0 7 9
```

Running the solver with this puzzle will produce the following output:

```
Sudoku solved:
5 3 4 | 6 7 8 | 9 1 2
6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 3 4 8
1 9 8 | 3 4 2 | 5 6 7
---------------------
8 5 9 | 7 6 1 | 4 2 3
4 2 6 | 8 5 3 | 7 9 1
7 1 3 | 9 2 4 | 8 5 6
---------------------
9 6 1 | 5 3 7 | 2 8 4
2 8 7 | 4 1 9 | 6 3 5
3 4 5 | 2 8 6 | 1 7 9
```
